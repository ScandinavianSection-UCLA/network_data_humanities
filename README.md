Network Data Sets for Humanities Inquiry

A repository for network data for Humanities inquiry, we encourage Humanities scholars to upload and share their network data to encourage broad scientific inquiry into the challenges of network analysis and visualization for and in the Humanities

Original motivation for this repository came from the NEH Institute for Advanced Topic in Digital Humanities on "Network Analysis for the Humanities", held at NSF's Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics in 2010-2011 (https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/summer-schools/networks-and-network-analysis-for-the-humanities-an-neh-institute-for-advanced-topics-in-digital-humanities/?tab=speaker-list)

Ongoing motivation for this repository comes from the Dagstuhl Seminar Network Visualization in the Humanities (Seminar 18482 https://www.dagstuhl.de/guestWiki/index.php/18482#Seminar_18482_-_Network_Visualization_in_the_Humanities)

We encourage scholars to upload and provide a short description of their data, along with citation requirements.
